# Changing the default access level for tenant owners

Bill as the cluster admin wants to reduce the privileges that tenant owners have, so they cannot create or edit Roles or bind them. As an admin of an OpenShift cluster, Bill can do this by assigning the `edit` role to all tenant owners. This is easily achieved by modifying the IntegrationConfig:

```yaml
apiVersion: tenantoperator.stakater.com/v1alpha1
kind: IntegrationConfig
metadata:
  name: tenant-operator-config
  namespace: stakater-tenant-operator
spec:
  tenantRoles:
    default:
      owner:
        clusterRoles:
          - edit
      editor:
        clusterRoles:
          - edit
      viewer:
        clusterRoles:
          - view
```

Once all namespaces reconcile, the old `admin` RoleBindings should get replaced with the `edit` ones for each tenant owner.

## Giving specific permissions to some tenants

Bill now wants the owners of the tenants `bluesky` and `alpha` to have `admin` permissions over their namespaces. Custom roles feature will allow Bill to do this, by modifying the IntegrationConfig like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: tenantoperator.stakater.com/v1alpha1
kind: IntegrationConfig
metadata:
  name: tenant-operator-config
  namespace: stakater-tenant-operator
spec:
  tenantRoles:
    default:
      owner:
        clusterRoles:
          - edit
      editor:
        clusterRoles:
          - edit
      viewer:
        clusterRoles:
          - view
    custom:
    - labelSelector:
        matchExpressions:
        - key: stakater.com/tenant
          operator: In
          values:
            - alpha
      owner:
        clusterRoles:
          - admin
    - labelSelector:
        matchExpressions:
        - key: stakater.com/tenant
          operator: In
          values:
            - bluesky
      owner:
        clusterRoles:
          - admin
```

New Bindings will be created for the Tenant owners of `bluesky` and `alpha`, corresponding to the `admin` Role. Bindings for editors and viewer will be inherited from the `default roles`. All other Tenant owners will have an `edit` Role bound to them within their namespaces
