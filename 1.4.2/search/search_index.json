It enables efficient resource utilization, reduces configuration overhead, and simplifies the sharing of internal cluster resources among tenants. However, achieving secure and functional multi-tenancy presents challenges such as ensuring security, maintaining fairness, and mitigating the impact of noisy neighbors.</p> <p>Kubernetes is inherently designed as a single-tenant platform. Managed Kubernetes services like AKS, EKS, GKE, and OpenShift have improved security through \"secure by default\" concepts, but designing and orchestrating all the moving parts required for a secure multi-tenant platform remains a complex task. This complexity makes it challenging for cluster administrators to effectively host multiple tenants within a single cluster.</p> <p>Clusters can be shared in various ways:</p> <ul> <li>Different applications might run in the same cluster.</li> <li>Multiple instances of the same application could operate within a single cluster, one for each end user.</li> </ul> <p>These scenarios are collectively referred to as multi-tenancy. While Kubernetes and many managed applications provide foundational resources to achieve multi-tenancy, leveraging these primitives requires professional expertise and deep knowledge of the platform.</p> <p>The Multi-Tenant Operator (MTO) builds on Kubernetes' capabilities, simplifying the orchestration of secure and efficient multi-tenancy. By addressing the unique needs of shared clusters, MTO helps cluster administrators overcome the inherent complexities of multi-tenancy, enabling them to harness its full potential.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>Refer to the installation guide for setting up MTO.</p>"},{"location":"changelog.html","title":"Changelog","text":""},{"location":"changelog.html#changelog","title":"Changelog","text":""},{"location":"changelog.html#v14x","title":"v1.4.x","text":"<p>To switch to 1.4.x version from earlier minor versions, following migration guide needs to be followed:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Uninstall <code>Multi Tenant Operator</code> Operator from your cluster for safe migration.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reinstall with the newer version.

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) will create the latest available InstallPlan which can be approved then.\n</code></pre> <p>As OLM does not allow to upgrade or downgrade from a version stuck because of error, the only possible fix is to uninstall the operator from the cluster. When the operator is uninstalled it removes all of its resources i.e., ClusterRoles, ClusterRoleBindings, and Deployments etc., except Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), so none of the Custom Resources (CRs), Tenants, Templates etc., will be removed from the cluster. If any CRD has a conversion webhook defined then that webhook should be removed before installing the stable version of the operator. This can be achieved via removing the <code>.spec.conversion</code> block from the CRD schema.</p> <p>As an example, if you have installed v0.8.0 of Multi Tenant Operator on your cluster, then it'll stuck in an error <code>error validating existing CRs against new CRD's schema for \"integrationconfigs.tenantoperator.stakater.com\": error validating custom resource against new schema for IntegrationConfig multi-tenant-operator/tenant-operator-config: [].spec.tenantRoles: Required value</code>. To resolve this issue, you'll first uninstall the MTO from the cluster. Once you uninstall the MTO, check Tenant CRD which will have a conversion block, which needs to be removed.

Namespace Controller Deployment The Namespace Controller is responsible for managing the creation, deletion, and updating of namespaces in the cluster. Resource Supervisor Deployment Deployment The Resource Supervisor Controller is responsible for managing sleep and hibernation of namespaces in the cluster via ResourceSupervisor CRD. Extensions Controller Deployment The Extensions Controller enhances MTO's functionality by allowing integration with external services. Currently, supports integration with ArgoCD, enabling you to synchronize your repositories and configure AppProjects directly through MTO. It manages extensions via Extension CRD. Quota Integration Config Controller Deployment The Quota Integration Config Controller manages 2 different CRDs in one controller, Quota CRD, and IntegrationConfig CRD. Webhook Deployment The Webhook is responsible for managing webhook requests from MTO's resources. Pilot Controller Deployment The Pilot Controller is responsible for provisioning and managing the lifecycle of MTO-Console and its dependencies. Keycloak Deployment Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution that provides authentication and authorization services for the MTO Console. It can be provisioned via Pilot Controller or deployed and managed externally following this guide External Keycloak. PostgreSQL StatefulSet PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database that acts as a caching layer and stores the data for the MTO Console. It is also provisioned via Pilot Controller and is managed internally. Opencost Deployment Opencost is an open-source cost management solution that provides cost tracking and reporting for the resources deployed on the cluster. It is also provisioned via Pilot Controller and is managed internally. Prometheus Deployment Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting solution that provides metrics and monitoring for the resources deployed on the cluster.

Kube-State-Metrics Deployment Kube-State-Metrics is a service that listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics about the state of the objects in the cluster. It is also provisioned via Pilot Controller and is managed internally. Showback CronJob The Showback CronJob is responsible for generating showback reports based on the resources present on the cluster by querying the Opencost-Gateway and storing the reports in the PostgreSQL database that can be viewed in the MTO Console on the Showback page. MTO Gateway Deployment The MTO-Gateway is the backend service that provides the REST API for the MTO-Console.

For namespaces that do not require a tenant name prefix, Bill employs the <code>namespaces.withoutTenantPrefix</code> field.</p> <p>Here's how Bill configures the Tenant CR to create these namespaces:</p> <pre><code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt; EOF\napiVersion: tenantoperator.stakater.com/v1beta3\nkind: Tenant\nmetadata:\n  name: bluesky\nspec:\n  quota: small\n  accessControl:\n    owners:\n      users:\n        - anna@aurora.org\n        - anthony@aurora.org\n    editors:\n      users:\n        - john@aurora.org\n      groups:\n        - alpha\n  namespaces:\n    withTenantPrefix:\n      - dev\n      - build\n    withoutTenantPrefix:\n      - prod\nEOF\n</code></pre> <p>This configuration ensures the creation of the desired namespaces, directly correlating them with the bluesky tenant.</p> <p>Upon applying the above configuration, Bill and the tenant members observe the creation of the following namespaces:</p> <pre><code>kubectl get namespaces\nNAME             STATUS   AGE\nbluesky-dev      Active   5m\nbluesky-build    Active   5m\nprod             Active   5m\n</code></pre> <p>Anna, as a tenant owner, gains the capability to further customize or create new namespaces within her tenant's scope. For example, creating a bluesky-production namespace with the necessary tenant label:</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n  name: bluesky-production\n  labels:\n    stakater.com/tenant: bluesky\n</code></pre> <p>\u26a0\ufe0f It's crucial for Anna to include the tenant label <code>tenantoperator.stakater.com/tenant: bluesky</code> to ensure the namespace is recognized as part of the bluesky tenant. Failure to do so, or if Anna is not associated with the bluesky tenant, will result in Multi Tenant Operator (MTO) denying the namespace creation.</p> <p>Following the creation, the MTO dynamically assigns roles to Anna and other tenant members according to their designated user types, ensuring proper access control and operational capabilities within these namespaces.</p>"},{"location":"kubernetes-resources/tenant/how-to-guides/create-namespaces.html#incorporating-existing-namespaces-into-the-tenant-via-argocd","title":"Incorporating Existing Namespaces into the Tenant via ArgoCD","text":"<p>For teams practicing GitOps, existing namespaces can be seamlessly integrated into the Tenant structure by appending the tenant label to the namespace's manifest within the GitOps repository.
